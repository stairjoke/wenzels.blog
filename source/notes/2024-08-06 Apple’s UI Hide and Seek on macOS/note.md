title: Apple’s UI Hide and Seek on macOS
date: 2024-08-06
teaser: I found that a UI component of macOS was hidden but functional in Safari.

I use the compact Tab Layout in Safari, which shows a theme color behind the Window Frame. I was today years old when I discovered that the Window Frame does show on the Start Page—I had just assumed it wasn’t there, but it is just well hidden. I already have "Reduce Transparency" turned on on my Mac to fix a lot of the hide-the-UI-problems of macOS, but Safari doesn’t seem to respect that preference in this case.

I thought I had to open a tab to see the buttons for my extensions in the Toolbar of Safari, because those vanish into the background image on the Start Page. The Window Frame has no background on the Start Page, it just plays hide and seek chameleon style unless a tab is opened. I think the usability of this part of the UI could be improved massively by not hiding it.
