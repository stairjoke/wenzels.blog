title: Apple software quality and declining Mac sales

teaser: Tim Cook believes that the Mac's recent sales slump could improve with the introduction of the M3 chip. I think he’s wrong and suspect that declining software quality from Apple is hurting Mac sales.

Tim Cook thinks the problem is hardware and that the M3 will change that. I’m pretty sure the declining software quality coming from Apple is playing a role in those 34%, more so than their hardware.

Anybody with an M1 or more recent Mac is pretty unlikely to buy a new one for a while, the hardware Apple put out in recent years is darn good. My M1 is still a faster computer than I need.
