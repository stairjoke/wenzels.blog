For as long as I can remember, any and all web-views and browsers on iOS had to use Apple's WebKit rendering engine to display web-content. It is how Apple was able to prevent Flash Player on iOS when it was still very popular.[^flash] And it is how Apple is able to prioritize battery life, memory usage, and performance on iOS so incredibly strictly.

I like the open web and I like competition, yet I am very skeptical Google truly has any serious interest in providing a superior experience on iOS compared to Apple. Quite the opposite, I wouldn't be surprised if installing Google Chrome using Blink instead of WebKit on your iPhone or iPad took away an extra hour of battery life. I'm more optimistic about Firefox, though. Mozilla is unlikely to have any interest in making people hate their iPhone so much they buy an Anrdoid phone. Firefox using its own engine on iOS might actually be good for the web.
