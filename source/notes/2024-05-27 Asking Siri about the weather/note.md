A real “conversation” I just had with Siri:

> Hey Siri, what’ll be the high temperature today?

The high will be 20°C today.

> Siri, when will we reach that high?

The high will be 20°C today.

> Muttering: You’re not being useful… Hey Siri, when will it be the warmest today?

The high will be 20°C today.

> Siri, at what point of the day will it be the warmest today?

The high will be 20°C today.

Here is to hoping Apple introduces a smarter Siri at WWDC 2024!
