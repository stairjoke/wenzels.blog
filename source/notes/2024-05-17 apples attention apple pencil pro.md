Quinn Nelson posted a [video on Threads](https://www.threads.net/@snazzyq/post/C7CpmYevMwf) about the astonishing and awesome attention to detail Apple put into the Apple Pencil Pro implementation. In the video, he demos that iPads display an accurate, 3D rendered shadow on screen which changes depending on the tool you selected.

I think the willingness at Apple to sweat such details is what makes Apple’s products delightful. Clearly, iPads are very high on the list of priorities for Apple right now, enabling the teams involved to spend time on details such as this. Here is to hoping a similar amount of love and care can be put towards macOS 15 before its release this fall!
