teaser: WWDC 2024 invites hint at a focus on gaming, I think. The German version suggests games and movies specifically.

My AppleID is registered in Germany which means I’m getting Apple’s WWDC invite in German, which might be relevant for some tea leaf reading—bear with me for a second. The German version of the invite suggests—I think more directly than the original English version—that WWDC 2024 will be focused on gaming and/or movies.

In English, Apple uses “Action packed” as a headline. In German, Apple uses “Actiongeladen”—there is no such word in German though. Here is why this might be relevant: Germans use “action” in a German sentence for mostly two specific things: games and movies.

I expect, with Apple’s push for more feature games on macOS, that this headline hints at improvements to the game porting kit and other technologies. Hell, they’ve dedicated a full section of their developer pages to games: [developer.apple.com/games/](https://developer.apple.com/games/) with the top-most link prompting developers to look at [Apple’s game porting kit,](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10123/) a tool designed to bring Windows/DirectX games engineered for Intel Windows PCs to Apple M-Series Macs.

Sure, I’m biased toward hoping this hints more at games than movies, but they already have AppleTV+. With Rosetta 2 and the game porting kit, maybe the investment for game developers becomes small enough to bring more games from Windows to Mac. Now that Microsoft is annoying its customers into switching away from Windows to macOS and Linux with unwanted AI features that add surveillance infrastructure to the OS, and ads in the start menu.[^switching1][^switching2][^switching3]
