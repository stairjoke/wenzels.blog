> Dear Apple Mail Team!
> I love Apple Mail! Its UX is just rightâ€”in my opinion. But I have to use an alternative because Apple Mail has no way to import PGP keys, neither those of others to send them encrypted emails, nor my private one to read messages. Not being able to use Apple Mail is very frustrating, especially when Apple says privacy is a right.

> I would immensely appreciate being able to import and export PGP keys in Apple Mail to read and write encrypted emails.

> Kind regards,
> Wenzel
