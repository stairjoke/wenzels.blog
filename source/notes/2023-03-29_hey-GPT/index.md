Three days ago, I published (link: /blog/2023/March/Apple-vs-AI text: Where is Apple in the AI race?) If you don’t want to wait until Apple is ready to publish its own LLM, you can extend Siri today to interface with OpenAI’s GPT and give you better answers immediately. All you need is an account at OpenAI — free or paid.

In (link: https://twitter.com/mckaywrigley/status/1640479688140398592?s=20 text: this tweet target: _blank) you’ll find a video demo of what it does and a (link: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0cc3e4195dfe46ffb901cb3348bc3c1e text: link to the shortcut. target: _blank)

1. Open (link: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys text: API keys on OpenAI.com, target: _blank) and generate an API key. Copy the key.
2. Download the shortcut and add it to your Shortcuts
3. Paste the key into the installation dialog of the *Hey GPT*-shortcut

To use “Hey GPT” activate Siri by saying “Hey Siri” or pressing the lock-button on your iPhone, then say “Hey GPT” and it will prompt you to speak your question. The responses from GPT will sometimes be wrong, but they’ll certainly be more useful than Siri’s.
