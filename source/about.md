# About
## Hello!

I’m a freelance designer and web-developer living in a tiny town in the [Swabian Jura.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabian_Jura) This is my blog — obviously. I write about many things; I write to think. Sometimes I feel like publishing what I write, thats what this blog is for.

I’m @stairjoke@indieweb.social on [Mastodon.](https://indieweb.social/@stairjoke) I also write a  [“professional” blog on (web-)design in German on my work-website](https://wenzels.design/notes), where I usually post notes specifically written for non-technical people.
