I’ve been cleaning up my digital footprint lately, and part of that is deleting unused accounts online. In 2013, while living with a host family in the USA for a couple of months, I spat into a 23andMe test tube. I’ve always been curious about tech, and they seemed like an interesting company in a field I still think is fascinating and important.

I guess taking the test the way I did was against their Terms of Service. I was (still am) neither a citizen of the US nor did I have a residence in the US (still don’t). Seeing as it was 11 years ago, I guess I can share this secret safely?

Before deleting my 23AndMe data and account, I requested a copy of all the data they have on me. It turns out the 23andMe iOS app uploaded a ton of data from the health app on my iPhone between June and September 2021. I must have given consent on that at some point, I guess? I’m wearing an Apple Watch, so 23AndMe has records of my heart rate, active calories, and much more.

This upload happened a long time after I had informed 23andMe that I was not living in the US and was a resident in an EU country they are not serving. For EU residents, 23andMe is only available in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, and Sweden today. I lived in Germany at that time. Before this upload happened, I had asked 23andMe Support to update my account with my German address. They informed me that existing accounts could not be transferred outside the US. I hope they have better reasons for this than lazy IT, but I can imagine there are some strict laws and regulations about health data and DNA records.

I think, after this conversation, 23andMe should have deleted my account and destroyed the sample of my DNA they froze back in 2013 for future testing. They did not.

As I did my test in 2013, I suspect my data is part of the recent hack. I expect that one day, my curiosity as a 22-year-old will come back to bite me, and an insurance company will use that data in some AI model to calculate risk factors.
