I will keep this brief, (link: /blog/2022/December/apple-music-ux  text: as opposed to when I wrote about Apple:) YouTube’s UX regarding language and region settings is a nightmare. Today, I tried paying for something on YouTube but couldn’t. Here is what happened:

For years I’ve had ad blockers active on YouTube because none of the ads have ever been relevant or anything other than annoying. Out of curiosity and because I want to support the YouTubers I watch, I sometimes disable the ad blockers for a day to see if the experience has improved. I always turn them back on because the experience is still bad. Since I travel a lot, ads are often in languages I don’t understand. I regularly manually set my account to “German” and “Germany” because it keeps forgetting that preference.

When you block ads on YouTube, the player makes you wait for the duration of the ad and shows a black or white screen. I think this is intentional, and I am certain YouTube knows I use an ad blocker. Almost every time during this wait, YouTube shows the “try YouTube Premium”-banner, and I usually click on it to see how much it would be to subscribe. I never subscribed because it was a bundle of everything YouTube had to offer, including YouTube Music. All I wanted was to pay to make the ads go away.

Today YouTube showed me a new banner, and I was delighted: An option to subscribe to YouTube Premium for much cheaper than usual that was only an ad-free experience without anything bundled into it. Perfect! I entered my credit card info, clicked next, and… was very frustrated and gave up, but not immediately. YouTube assumed the country I’m currently in is where I live, and the form did not allow me to change my billing address to the correct country. It assumed I had a Dutch billing address. I don’t. I also checked the frequently asked questions. The first thing I found was angry comments from people who also could not find a way to change the billing address country and had tried repeatedly for more than two years.

**In case it wasn’t clear: Dear YouTube management, this is terrible UX.**

Because it didn’t allow me to change the country, I clicked the menu on the right to select the correct region and language, as I’ve done many times before. I am currently in the Netherlands. The preferences showed YouTube set to the United Kingdom locale, but German language… ok, whatever. I changed it to German and Germany and went back to the Youtube Premium signup page. Now it looked like this:

I marked several areas on this screenshot to illustrate the issue I ran into:

1. YouTube correctly shows that I am looking at the German edition of YouTube
2. The locale preference also shows Germany
3. The language preference shows German
4. The price is in £ (UK pound) — on the German website.

Additionally, the option to subscribe to the cheaper “only ads-free” tier without music is nowhere to be found. I tried emptying my browser cache, thinking maybe it still has the UK locale cached somewhere, as it is showing prices in pounds, but no luck. After clicking a round a bit, I gave up and decided not to subscribe.

## What could they have done to get my money?
The answer is very simple: Allow me to change the country of my billing address in the payment form. And show the same selection of offers to the same person after they change their locale.

My best guess here is that YouTube Germany does not offer the same subscriptions as YouTube UK — or was it YouTube NL's offer in the beginning? Anyways, the result is that I will not be paying YouTube.
