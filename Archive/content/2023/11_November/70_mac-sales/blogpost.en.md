Tim Cook thinks the problem is hardware and that the M3 will change that. I’m pretty sure the declining software quality coming from Apple is playing a role in those 34%, more so than their hardware.

Anybody with an M1 or more recent Mac is pretty unlikely to buy a new one for a while, the hardware Apple put out in recent years is darn good. My M1 is still a faster computer than I need.
