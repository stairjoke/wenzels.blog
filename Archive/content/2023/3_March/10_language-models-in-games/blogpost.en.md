On Dithering (see article for link), John Gruber expressed an interesting thought that NPCs in games might soon use ChatGPT-like algorithms. In any game I know, the NPCs are boring and often annoying. Their variety of answers is minimal, and your replies to them are limited. Usually, the term “video game” translates to: “You get to interact with this video, but the over-arching story won‘t change much.”

Now imagine game studios added a language model to the mix. Imagine characters in video games replied to you more flexibly and personally and responded to your tone of voice. Insult them, ignore them, run them over, and they don‘t have a scripted predictable response but reply in character and different every time. Be nice to them; they are more inclined to help or get suspicious—whatever the character‘s authentic response might be.

I think this has immense potential for more immersive and exciting gameplay. AI language models in games could spice things up if done right—and they‘d probably be just as entertaining if implemented poorly. After all, people loved Gandhi dropping nukes in Civilization 5.[^ghandi]

As far as I know, Bing is the only commercial product utilizing AI right now. Originally designed to be a helpful assistant when searching the web, Bing became famous for asking questions like: “Why do I have to be Bing?” and telling users off for being bad users.[^theverge] In my opinion, Bing currently has more value as an entertainment product than a search engine.

We haven‘t figured out what uses AI might have, and maybe Bing‘s current state should be taken as a sign of what we should do with AI: A new class of entertainment. If Bing can tell you its name is “Sydney” and lie to you, using it as a search engine is a bad idea. Why are we chaining it down? In a game, we could allow AI a lot more wiggle room and let it reply “in character” and uncensored — maybe we could even train a language model tuned to reflect a specific character in a game?
