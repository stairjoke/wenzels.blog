In Germany, we have a saying: “Not scolding is praise enough.” (German: “Nicht geschimpft ist Lob genug.”), and with this mindset, many Germans remain quiet until they have something to be mad about. And Germans have been complaining about the Deutsche Bahn (Germany’s national rail company: DB) loudly, passionately, and for decades. We love to hate it, and unfortunately, it loves to give us reasons to do so. But it also gives us reasons to shut up.

In the past decades, DB has invested billions into building a new high-speed railway between two cities in the south of Germany. The new track, (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendlingen–Ulm_high-speed_railway text: “Wendlingen–Ulm high-speed railway,” target: _blank) is designed to accommodate trains traveling at up to 250kph (155mph) and cuts through mountainous terrain across the Swabian Jura — a rail-road-nightmare-terrain full of steep mountains and even steeper valleys. As part of (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart_21 text: the Stuttgart 21 project, target: _blank) DB built 37 bridges and dug eleven tunnels to build this 60km stretch high-tech track, which cuts the traveling time between Ulm and Stuttgart in half.

I like traveling by train. I don’t mind that it takes longer than flying, and electric trains in Germany run on renewable power. The CO<sub>2</sub> footprint compared to that of an airplane is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> that of flying the same distance, according to (link: http://www.ecopassenger.org/ text: www.ecopassenger.org. target: _blank) In Germany’s long-distance trains you usually get decent WiFi, the seating is reasonably comfortable in second class and roomy in first. If you plan your trip a few days or weeks ahead, you usually get your pick of reserved seating at a table with a power socket. And on top of that, the food in Germany’s (link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercity_Express text: ICE fleet target: _blank) is much better (and cheaper) than what you usually get when flying. In summary: You travel with free WiFi, in comfort, at high speeds, and you do not have to pay attention to the road or wait in line at security.

## When things go wrong
So far, this post might read like an advertisement for DB. Most of the time, when I travel by train, it all goes well, and I have nothing to complain about. But sometimes DB screws up so royally that it’s worth blogging about. Let me tell you the story of traveling from Utrecht, Netherlands, to the south of Germany. Spoiler: I arrived almost two hours late and switched trains several more times than expected.

On Friday morning, I got out of the house wearing a backpack, carrying a duffle bag and one extra bag. The fog had frozen to the ground, and I saw my bus come and go while I stumbled to the bus stop. No matter, buses run every few minutes here. Arriving at the central station Utrecht Centraal, I had some time to kill — I always make sure I arrive a bit early when I have to catch a long-distance train. While waiting, I heard an announcement about my train:

> Dear passengers, the international train ICE 105 from Amsterdam to Karlsruhe is only one coach. Passengers traveling domestically are requested to use another train.

Usually, this train consists of two trains coupled in the middle to form one double-length giant. It is common for Germany’s high-speed rail to have double trains, as traveling by rail is fairly popular. A coach, in this case, is one of those two trains and has nine wagons. This train was supposed to seat 806 people and carry 1,212 people — these trains are allowed to carry twice as many people as they can seat. And recently, many of these trains were close to capacity. Pro tip: you should book a seat as well as a ticket.

Back to the issue at hand: Half of my train was missing. This reduced the capacity from 1,212 passengers to 806. Take a minute to imagine the mayhem — got a headache yet? Let’s keep going.

The good news first: At the next stop, the second coach was connected, and the situation relaxed. The bad news came when I checked the DB app on my phone and saw that my connecting train from Cologne to Ulm (about 400km/250mi) was going to be delayed by 90 Minutes. The reason: It was the first icy day of the year, and they had an issue getting the train ready in the morning.

**Dear DB,**
What the *#+/#!? Have you heard of the “weather forecast”? It’s a thing, quite useful. People have been using it for decades. Try it!

Anyways, my connecting train was delayed, and in my experience, trains delayed by an hour or more have a good chance of not showing up. What to do? I still had another 600km to go, so I decided to board the next train traveling in the right direction, and hoped for the best. Reserved seating be dammed! While on that train, I checked the DB app for more info from time to time, hoping for some sort of good news.

More bad news: There was a medical emergency in Fulda, and all trains coming from that direction or going there were delayed indefinitely. The train I was hoping to catch was one of them. However, the train I was originally supposed to board in Cologne was still en route. It was delayed, but “only” by 110 Minutes, not indefinitely. I got out of the overcrowded train I had hitched a ride on at Frankfurt Airport and waited. It’s a nice place to wait for a train with german punctuality, and I recommend the orange juice in the Segafredo Café!

Finally, my train arrived, and I got in! “Wait a minute, where am I?” The train ran in reverse order that day, something usually announced before the train arrives to allow people to walk to the right spot on the platform to get to their reserved seats easily. This time, it was not announced, and as a few hundred people tried to walk in opposite directions through this overcrowded 200m (650ft) long train, from one end to the other, crossing each other’s path, I was one of them. I had to get from wagon 3 to 12, and it took 25 minutes.

In Germany, a delayed train has to give way to all other trains. This is so there is no domino effect of one delayed train causing delays for other trains. I was sitting on a train that left Frankfurt Airport with about 110 minutes delay. You can see where this is going, right? We had to wait for other trains basically every 20 minutes, accumulating an even longer delay every single wait. It felt like we were crawling along at walking speeds or just standing around in the middle of nowhere. My train had to give way to dozens of other trains. Again, and again, and again…

Finally, after an agonizing few hours of barely getting anywhere we arrived in Stuttgart, the last stop before the new track — Wendlingen-Ulm. But we were delayed, so much in fact that my train was re-routed to use the old track, I suspect to avoid the above mentioned domino effect of delays. I'd been looking forward to finally seeing the new track. Being re-routed to the older and slower track after a day of forced dawdling felt like adding insult to injury. The high-speed train I was sitting in had to stay below 80kph (50mph) the whole way.

We arrived in Ulm with 150 minutes delay. It was cold and that train station is — I think — very unappealing. Of course, I missed my connecting train. How could I not, being more than two hours delayed? So I completed the last leg of my journey in yet another delayed train, arriving almost two hours late. 

## Conclusion
Traveling with Deutsche Bahn can be incredibly luxurious and comfortable, fast, and relatively affordable. I wrote this whole article while taking the train from Ulm to Cologne. We’re “only” ten minutes late, the ride is comfortable and quiet, the WiFi works, and there is enough space for everyone. When it goes wrong tho, traveling with Deutsche Bahn can feel like hell on earth. The DB's mechanisms to deal with and resolve issues seem insufficient to cope with it‘s problems. Germany is in the middle of Europe’s rail network, and Germany is running it‘s rail infrastructure as a for-profit enterprise, which seems to be harming Germany's and Europe's economies. Maybe it is time to reconsider this approach and run rail as an infrastructure investment instead, Germany?
