Let's coin a term, Brecation: The years in which the UK is/was not part of the EU, before applying to re-join it.

I remember the controversy leading up to the Brexit vote vividly. Some people promising Britain would return to its old glory, if just freed from the shackles of the EU, others predicting its demise the nanosecond it was cut-off from trade with the EU. To me, it felt like Britain was going on vacation away from the EU, only to return at a later date and re-join as a less pampered member once everybody had calmed down.

It is 2022 now, and after Brexit and COVID, the UK is suffering economically. A few examples:

- Small businesses are suffering from the increased difficulties importing and exporting their goods (see. (link: https://youtu.be/wO2lWmgEK1Y text: The Brexit effect by the Financial Times on YouTube target: _blank)).
- Travel for EU citizens has become a lot more difficult. You can't use your regular photo ID anymore, you need a passport. This means it became a lot less convenient for hundreds of millions of Europeans to vacation in the UK. Personally, it would take me just a few hours by train to go to London. And I'd love to go there for a weekend trip, but like many citizens of the EU, I only have a regular photo ID, and no passport — and getting one costs money and takes a few weeks. Instead of going to London by train, I just take another one to go to Berlin or Paris now.
- And some students from within the EU, who would have studied in the UK, can't afford to do so anymore. They study elsewhere now, mostly inside the EU.

All of this and more is hitting the UK economy hard, hard enough to re-kindle the Brexit debate, (link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/world/europe/uk-brexit-regret.html text: as the New York Times reports. target: _blank)

I think, in time, either parts of the UK will become independent and apply to join the EU on their own, or the UK will return to becoming a member of the EU. I just hope this time they join as “normal” members, without any of the special treatment that used to set them apart from other members.
