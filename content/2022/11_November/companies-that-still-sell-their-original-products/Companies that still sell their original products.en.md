This quote sent me down a small rabbit hole and I felt like sharing what I found:

**Apple** still sells desktop computers. They’re no longer called Apple I, Apple II, or Apple Lisa, but the Macintosh lineup is alive and well. With Apple Silicon (the M-Chip series) the Macintosh isn’t just alive and well, it is leading the PC market in many aspects, such as power consumption and compute performance while on battery power.

**Google** has become synonymous with it’s first product: search. And they are dominating and innovating in this field, adding alternative input sources that can be combined with the traditional text query. Now, when you search something on the internet, even while using a competitor’s search engine, you’re googling.

**Meta,** formerly Facebook, runs facebook, the social network. But a series of unfortunate decisions have made the company, and all its products, undesirable for many. Much like Tesla and Twitter, the company suffers from the bad reputation of its CEO.

**Intel’s** first product was the 3101 Static-RAM, and Intel does not sell RAM anymore. They still sell other forms of memory, but those are fundamentally different, as they are permanent storage.

**Microsoft’s** first product, the Altair BASIC released in 1975, helped developers write software. And 47 years later, Microsoft still has products focused on helping developers write software, one of them is Visual Basic and the Visual Studio.

**IBM;** It was a bit more difficult to find out what their first product was. Originating from four companies, IBM was founded (consolidated) in 1911 as Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, short CTR. It has been around for a while and is 111 years old in 2022. If you really want to be picky, one of those four companies was founded in 1889 and sold the Bundy Key Time Recorder, a time recording clock for the workplace for up to six employees. Does IBM still sell time recording hardware? No, not specifically. You can certainly use their software to keep track of your employees work hours, its just not a specialized product anymore.
