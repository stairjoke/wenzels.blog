In a recent Dithering episode,[^dithering] John Gruber argued the Dynamic Island, introduced with the iPhones 14 Pro and Pro Max, is likely limited to Apple devices with Pro Motion displays — displays that support 120Hz. Under Steve Jobs / Jony Ive I would have agreed, but under Tim Cook, Apple has become a number crunching machine built to sell. I doubt they’ll limit this feature to 120Hz capable displays for long. It will probably look less sexy on 60Hz, but still sexy enough to sell iPhones.

From a UI design and engineering perspective I wonder if the animations for the Dynamic Island will need to be adjusted to look right at relatively lower frame rates? I believe part of the illusion of the Dynamic Island, besides the inky black of the OLED display, is how “real” the very smooth animations make it feel.
