You might have noticed I did not post anything in a very long time and in case you were wondering if I died: <q cite="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/the-reports-of-my-death-are-greatly-exaggerated">The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.</q>

I expectedly moved house, then unexpectedly moved house again, and then unexpectedly moved house a third time. So, naturally, none of my belongings are where I think they are any my life is ~~a little crazy~~ right now. Iâ€™ll be back.
