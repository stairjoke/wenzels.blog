Hello!
How are you? I hope you’re doing well! If you’re new here: Welcome! If you read beachball.tech before, welcome to my new place! You might have noticed that I didn’t write anything on beachball.tech in the past months. Amongst the changes I made, I moved my blog from beachball.tech to this much more personal but neutral domain: [“wenzels.blog”](https://wenzels.blog). Let me catch you up!

## A more personal, open, and positive blog

To be frank, beachball.tech was a project born from many moments of frustration over a prolonged period of time. Frustration mainly caused by Apple products and by working in technical support for a native Mac app. When I came up with beachball.tech, I figured it was witty to brand a blog about technology and design with the spinning disk cursor[^spinningDisk] of macOS in mind. I don’t think that anymore — I’m actually quite annoyed by my original choice.

[^spinningDisk]: Similar to the hourglass cursor in Windows, macOS shows a special cursor when an application becomes unresponsive. That cursor is meant to resemble a spinning optical disk and was originally designed for the NextStep Operating System.

In the early months of this year, beachball.tech increasingly began to feel like it provoked a negative vibe, and I stopped posting. Admittedly, the demise of Twitter may have had something to do with my mood too. It also rubbed me the wrong way to be part of a growing group of grumpy, sometimes cynical, commentators in the Apple-sphere. I appreciate honest and respectful criticism, but the negativity that some not-a-fan-anymore Apple commentators display online feels bitter and resentful, and it bugs me. I don’t want to be part of that bubble. And that is why I felt I had to move domains before I could publish new content.

By deciding to post on a domain that is literally *“my name dot blog”* (wenzels.blog), I am giving myself permission to write in a more personal and relaxed way. Beachball.tech also implied a focus on the failures and missteps of Apple and the technology sector in general. That is not a focus I want to set as the foundation of my blog, especially when so many cool and positive things are happening. I also let the name deter me from posting more about design — but I studied design and I would love to blog about some design topics. Something to look forward to, if you’re into more than just the technical side of things!

## Technology updates
### Kirby CMS
I built this blog fresh and from the ground up without re-using any old code. It is build on the Kirby CMS, a wonderful little content management system designed to be more like a framework than anything else. Kirby is flexible. It allows me to manage my content independently from the design of this site — I could even use it headless.[^headless]

[^headless]: A *“headless”* CMS (Content Management System) is a piece of software you can run on an internet connected computer to manage content such as articles, videos, or the contents of a podcast. A traditional CMS serves a website, such as this website, to present the content it was build to manage. Headless CMS’ serve content not to a website, but in another way — they might serve an app, for example. The Kirby CMS can serve a website, but it is perfectly happy to serve JSON files as well or even instead.

### Multi language support
While developing this site I focused mainly on the technological foundation — the design will be a work in progress for some time. One of the things I decided to spend a lot of effort on was to engineer for localization and translation. This blog is currently bilingual and has the underpinnings to support as many languages as I could ever want to throw at it. It will render times and dates correctly for any locale and language I choose to add, and all permalinks will automatically connect visitors to their preferred language or fall back to English.

Why? Because I live in Germany, speak German, but prefer to write in English most of the time. Why shouldn’t I use that as an advantage to blog about technology from not just the English speaking world, but also Germany, Switzerland, and Austria?

### Support for old URLs
If you follow a link to any article ever published on beachball.tech, you will be forwarded to its counterpart here on wenzels.blog. Even those articles I decided to "unpublish" by making them invisible in the navigation, RSS feed, and for search engines, will forward you correctly.
