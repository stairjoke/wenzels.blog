We stood by and watched while Putin made Russia into a dictatorship. We stood by and watched while Xi made China into one too. We’re standing by and watching Poland, Turkey, and Israel. We are not angry enough, not engaged enough, and not in the streets to protest. We are stupid, lazy, and irresponsible—too much so for our democracies to thrive and protect each other.

Our mentality is: “Just leave me in peace, let me watch Netflix, let me rage at the news every other day, but don’t make me get off my couch!“ We are the frog, and for most of us, the heat is climbing so slowly it works.[^frog]

Democracy works if the people rule/have power. That is the concept of *dēmos* (the people) and *kratos* (the power or to rule).[^oxford] Lately, we’ve been watching as *kratos* is shifted away from *dēmos* by shifty people, and I think we’re not angry enough. Go vote while you still can, protest peacefully while you still can, or, one day, you won’t be asked to vote anymore and won’t be allowed to protest anymore.
