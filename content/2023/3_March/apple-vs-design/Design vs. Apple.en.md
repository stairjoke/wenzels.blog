I have heard that Apple has moved from being a design-driven to a numbers-driven company before. To me, it looks like the core values are all still there, though.

I have heard that Apple has moved from being a design-driven to a numbers-driven company before. To me, it looks like the core values are all still there, though. Apple still makes distinctly different choices than the competition, and most of the time, Apple aims to make the best decision for its customers. Sometimes the objective of making money gets in the way, though. Apple tried adding more adds to the AppStore and ended up advertising for gambling apps on the AppStore pages of self-help apps.[^theverge]

The customers, competition, and political climate Apple finds itself in these days are very different from when Steve Jobs and Jony Ive invented the iMac and iPod. While at its core still the same company, Apple under Tim Cook has to navigate very different waters than it did under Steve. There is no way for Apple to carry on without adapting to an ever-changing world, I believe, unless it wants to risk becoming a small company again. I like the concept of small, passionate companies, but that’s another story. Apple is no longer a small disruptor thinking differently. It is a giant corporation competing with other big corporations.

All that said, I miss the Apple that cared about every single pixel on the screen, moved product launches to the future for as long as was necessary, and was generally just interested in making the best products it could.
