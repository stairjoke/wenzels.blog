Teaser:

Mastodon is distributed, like email. You can have email accounts at one of the giants, like Gmail.com or iCloud.com, or at a smaller provider like Proton.me or Posteo.de. And you can even run your own email server. The same is true for Mastodon: You can pick a provider you like or run your own server and make an account.

Mastodon is distributed, like email. You can have email accounts at one of the giants, like Gmail.com or iCloud.com, or at a smaller provider like Proton.me or Posteo.de. And you can even run your own email server. The same is true for Mastodon: You can pick a provider you like or run your own server and make an account.

The beauty of Mastodon is that it isn’t centralized. Not all of Mastodon is on Mastodon.social or Mastodon.online. Unfortunately, this is also confusing for many people coming from Twitter.com, a service limited to one address.

Your username will be “@username@provider”, almost like email. You can access Mastodon on the web or with an app. On the web, you open your server’s website—like signing into Gmail.com to read your emails, even if those emails came from someone using iCloud.com. If you prefer to use an app, search for Mastodon on your device‘s App Store and install any one of the many apps available. I like (link: https://tapbots.com/ivory/ text: Ivory, target: _blank) an app by Tapbots. You might prefer another app.

For me, opening ”the Mastodon website” means opening (link: https://indieweb.social/ text: Indieweb.social. target: _blank) For you, it will be whatever server you choose. Some web-apps allow you to sign into multiple Mastodon accounts at the same time, like (link: https://elk.zone text: Elk.zone. target: _blank) Once you have one or more Mastodon accounts, you can use Elk to access all of them in one place. Elk also looks really nice ☺️

To find people, use the search and remember to add the @server part to their user name—they might be living on another server than you are.

You can find a list of available Mastodon servers in many places. Any of those lists may be incomplete; it is a decentralized network after all. No *one* person is ever in charge like there is at Twitter.

Remember: Mastodon servers are mostly run by volunteers, including the content moderation work. Consider donating to help keep the servers running, or become part of the people running the places. If you notice reporting abusive users doesn't work well, consider helping out or switching to another server.
