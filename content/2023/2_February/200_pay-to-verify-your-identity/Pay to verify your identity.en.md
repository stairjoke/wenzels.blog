Two things came to my mind reading the announcement:

1. Musk started a trend by making it a paid and premium feature to be verified and have protection against impersonation.
2. It has become a trend to charge more when people subscribe via the Apple AppStore.

## One — Charging for verification
The need to stop impersonation and verify accounts was glaringly evident for about a decade. Big platforms did not act, probably because it meant they would have had to kick people out, which would have hurt their "monthly active users"-number. And hence their stock price and advertising revenue. I think, not verifying people was profitable. It probably still is. In my opinion, not verifying comes at a cost to our society and dignity. It comes at the expense of enabling anonymous hate speech and other harmful activities.

Musk opened the gates to a way out for companies such as ~~Facebook~~ Meta: He introduced Twitter Blue. A way to buy verification without requiring a photo ID (which went terribly.[^engadget] But he crossed a line the others did not dare to: He asked for money to be verified and opened the door for more companies to do the same. They'll just do it a little smarter and get praised for it because they'll avoid the mistakes Musk made.

<p class=quotable>What paying to be verified reminds me of is corrupt countries where you have to bribe your way through the bureaucracy.</p>

Verifying users increases the platform's value, in my opinion, and will likely reduce its negative impact on society. It should be mandated by governments, and it should be mandated to be free of charge. Meta will roll this out in Australia and New Zealand first, and it would be an absolute power move by those governments to put such a law into effect as a direct and immediate response. What paying to be verified reminds me of is corrupt countries where you have to bribe your way through the bureaucracy.

## Two — Handing off AppStore fees to users
I get it. Apple has been squeezing the AppStore for profits like there is no tomorrow. Apple added advertising to the AppStore and takes 15% or 30% (depending on the developer) of each transaction. To get in at all, and even to add free-to-use Apps, developers must join the Apple Developer Program, which costs just under 100 USD annually. And there is no alternative AppStore. Developers have no choice but to pay Apple and comply with their rules. I think that is the underlying problem here. Retailers have always had a margin on each sale, some as high as 100%, but manufacturers were not limited to selling their products exclusively with one retailer. There was competition. With the Apple AppStore, there is no competition. If you want your Apps to be available for iPhone, you have to pay Apple.

All that was already reason enough for many developers to be angry, but Apple really poked the hornet’s nest when it introduced the “Ask App Not to Track”-feature to stop Apps from spying on you.[^macworld] What Apple is doing is asking developers for money while attacking their revenue stream. At the same time, Apple exempted its own apps from the “Do not track”-rule.[^9to5mac] I like that Apple is working against Apps tracking their users, it’s among the reasons I’m writing this on a Mac. At the same time, they’re being hypocritical about it by exempting themselves.

<p class=quotable>Companies are now asking users for more money for the same service if they decide to purchase it via the AppStore instead of anywhere else.</p>

It looks like, as a result of Apple collecting 15% or 30% on each transaction, and there being no alternative to the AppStore, companies are now asking users for more money for the same service if they decide to purchase it via the AppStore instead of anywhere else.
