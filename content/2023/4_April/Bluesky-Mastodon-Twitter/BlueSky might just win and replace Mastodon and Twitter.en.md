I used to be an avid Twitter user for over a decade, but ever since Musk sunk it, I switched to Mastodon. Now there is BlueSky,[^bsky] and although I want to root for Mastodon, I find myself convinced BlueSky will become the dominant Twitter replacing platform in short order.

[^bsky]: BlueSky is normally not spelled with an uppercase "S", but there is a problem with that name for people relying on screen-readers. Computers pronounce "Bluesky" as "blueskii"; however, when you "camel-case" the name by writing the "S" in uppercase, it is typically pronounced correctly ("blue sky") by screen readers. I encourage everyone to spell it "BlueSky" (with an uppercase "S"), and just like the users of Twitter invented the @mention (at-mention) and the #tag (hashtag), we might raise some awareness to spell things in a screen-reader friendly way.

## The companies behind BlueSky and Mastodon
Mastodon is a company and the name of the decentralized social media platform Mastodon. The company Mastodon gGmbH is a German non-profit company, translated the abbreviation gGmbH stands for "non-profit limited liability company" (German: "gemeinnützige Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung"). The company develops the Mastodon software, which is the “Operating System” behind Mastodon, the social network.

BlueSky is also a company and the name of the decentralized social media platform BlueSky. The company “Bluesky PBLLC” is a US for-profit company. The abbreviation PBLLC stands for “Public Benefit Limited Liability Company”, a for-profit limited liability company founded with the stated intention to promote a public social benefit.

## The networks BlueSky and Mastodon
Mastodon gGmbH runs mastodon.online, one of the many instances of Mastodon. Anybody can download Mastodon for free and install it on their server to run their own social media platform. And all Mastodon installations, usually called “instances”, can be configured to talk to each other using ActivityPub—an open-source protocol.

If you just want to use Mastodon to post and connect with people, you’ll find a public list of instances you can sign up with, including Mastodon.online, on the official website (link: https://joinmastodon.org/servers text: joinmastodon.org target: _blank).

BlueSky, the app, is in public beta, and as far as I can tell, there is currently no way to download their software and run it on your own server—but it seems like there will be. BlueSky develops the AT Protocol to enable all BlueSky servers to talk to each other.

## Why might BlueSky win?
What we have are two competing companies founded to benefit the public, both want to become the standard for all decentralized social media networks, one is a non-profit and open source, and the other is a for-profit. BlueSky seems to look at itself as a platform provider for anybody who wants to build a social network, as much as it looks at itself as a user of its own platform with the bsky.app.

In a recent interview with The Verge, the CEO of BlueSky highlighted what she thinks makes BlueSky, the social network, better than Mastodon:

> We’ve designed a protocol that has three big things we think are missing from the Mastodon ecosystem: account portability, global discoverability, [and] composable, customizable curation, and moderation.

<p class=quotable>I believe Mastodon’s biggest weakness and the reason many content creators are still stuck on Twitter is the lack of “global discoverability” </p>

Having used both Twitter and Mastodon, as well as a host of other platforms, I believe Mastodon’s biggest weakness and the reason many content creators are still stuck on Twitter is the lack of “global discoverability”. I wrote about that in the conclusion of (link: https://beachball.tech/blog/2023/February/social-media-ROI text: my article on the ROI of social media,) where I suggest that if you have something to promote, you should sign up for an account on an algorithm-driven platform. Any platform that focuses on solving this discoverability issue will easily win over Mastodon, in my opinion. Hence, I believe BlueSky will outgrow Mastodon quickly. In the 21st century, people need places to promote their businesses, and Mastodon is a poor candidate for mass-market products.

BlueSky seems to understand this. They present three pillars on their website that make their product valuable:

(image: bluesky.jpeg caption: A screenshot of BlueSky’s AT Protocol documentation on atproto.com, showing the pillars “Federated social — Connect with anyone on any service that’s using the AT Protocol.”, “Algorithmic choice — Control how you see the world through an open market of algorithms.” and “Portable accounts — Change hosts without losing your content, your follows, or your identity.”)

I believe the algorithm pillar is the most significant one. Mastodon is federated, and moving your account is partially possible, but there is no serious initiative to implement an algorithm—let alone a market for algorithms. And it is that algorithm that makes the difference. Without an algorithm on Mastodon, you are forced to focus. You have to keep the number of people you follow small enough so you can still keep up with their posts. Additionally, every instance is a bit of a silo — content posted in one Mastodon instance is hard to discover in another. These problems are intrinsic to the ActivityPub protocol upon which Mastodon is built.

Instead of building no algorithm like Mastodon, or one for all users like Twitter or TikTok, BlueSky seems to plan a marketplace of algorithms. Genius! This creates a platform on which competing algorithms for different purposes can be built. I expect there will be different flavors, surfacing different kinds of posts to their respective users. And at the heart of it all is the AT Protocol.

## Should you join BlueSky?
I signed up for the waitlist because I see real value in BlueSky. If they pull this off, then the AT Protocol might just become the foundation upon which the next TikTok or Twitter is built.
