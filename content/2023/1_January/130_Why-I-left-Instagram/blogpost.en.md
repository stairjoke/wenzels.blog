Being the tech enthusiast I am, I moved from Flickr to Instagram shortly after its first release. I loved it. It wasn‘t just “the new thing,” it was actually a pleasure to use and a great community of interesting people. I mostly used it to post pictures on Twitter, which did not have first-party support for anything but text back then. Over time, Instagram evolved into a competitor of Twitter, and eventually, it was bought by Facebook. It lost its charm, Facebook was already a dirty word in my mind back then, and I decided to delete my account. I lost lots of memories. I was young and thought I wouldn‘t miss anything I posted on Instagram—I was wrong, by the way. Download your data from socials you delete!

A few years later, maybe even half a decade later, I created an account on Instagram again. It had become hard to avoid if you wanted to stay in touch with friends online. My heart wasn't in it. I barely posted things. Also, Instagram has changed—a lot! It isn't about great and creative photos anymore, its about being popular and selling shit nobody needs. Opening it feels like walking into a brightly lit arcade in a dystopian sci-fi flick where upon entering, you‘re immediately accosted by salespeople and loud annoying noises. The Facebook algorithm has ruined this formerly fantastic space. It made it into a hellscape of ads, autoplay videos, and suggested posts from people I don't know or care about.

I tried cleaning my feed by unfollowing a bunch of people and telling Instagram I wanted to see fewer suggested posts. Instagram retaliated by adding more suggested posts and ads to my feed. This morning I decided I was done with Instagram for good. If anybody really wants to reach out, they can—I am literally one web search away.
