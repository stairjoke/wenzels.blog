Teaser: Meta was fined USD 1.3B and seems to think it doesn’t have to change how it does business. The EU and US are trying to figure out how GDPR and the Patriot Act can coexist peacefully—I think in vain. And EU companies use US services that are probably not compliant with GDPR to compete in the digital market.

> Meta on Monday was fined a record 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) and ordered to stop transferring data collected from Facebook users in Europe to the United States […]
> […]
> At the same time, European Union and American officials are negotiating a new data-sharing pact that would provide legal protections for Meta and scores of other companies to continue moving information between the United States and Europe — a pact that could nullify much of the European Union’s ruling on Monday. A preliminary deal was announced last year.

> The case against Meta stems from U.S. policies that give intelligence agencies the ability to intercept communications from abroad, including digital correspondence. In 2020, an Austrian privacy activist, Max Schrems, won a lawsuit to invalidate a U.S.-E.U. pact, known as Privacy Shield, that had allowed Facebook and other companies to move data between the two regions. <mark>The European Court of Justice said the risk of [a US agency intercepting communications] violated the fundamental rights of European users.</mark>[^nyt]

GDPR and the Patriot Act can not coexist peacefully. This has not changed since day one of GDPR. And whatever deal might be struck eventually to bridge the gap will almost certainly be challenged in EU courts and declared invalid. To the best of my knowledge, you cannot bring GDPR and the Patriot Act together in their current form. After looking into expert opinions on this repeatedly over the years since GDPR entered into force, I had to accept that this is not legally possible.

<p class=quotable>Many US companies think they are GDPR compliant when they are not, and some of the companies I build websites for are scared to use services hosted in the US.</p>

I’ve been working as a web designer and developer since before GDPR. The struggle to find infrastructure and services compliant with GDPR is significant. Many US companies think they are GDPR compliant when they are not, and some of the companies I build websites for are scared to use services hosted in the US. These US companies transfer unencrypted data between the EU and the US like we’re still in pre-GDPR times. Many European companies ignore this and use these pretending-to-be-compliant US-based company’s services anyways, because there are no affordable or viable alternatives in the EU. Many innovations in the technology sector never become available from an EU-based company, making the non-GDPR compliant use of those innovations the only way to compete in the digital market.[^gdpr]

GDPR forces EU-based companies to build the IT infrastructure it used to get cheaply from the US. At the same time, US companies providing this cheap infrastructure continue to offer it in Europe, knowing many people will do business with them at the risk of fines.

The Times continues:

> […] Meta said it was being unfairly singled out for data-sharing practices used by thousands of companies.[^nyt]

This one is particularly interesting, as it signals a lack of understanding on Meta’s part. EU privacy officers do not willy nilly start an investigation when they feel like it (or out of spite). A complaint by another user or company has to be filed for a privacy officer to launch an investigation. The fact that Meta feels singled out indicates to me that Europeans are particularly likely to file complaints against Meta.

    Some examples of services lacking high quality EU-market alternatives:
    
    - Squarespace and Webflow (website-builder web-apps)
    - Google Mail, Calendar, Drive and Microsoft Office 365 (office suites)
    - YouTube
    - MailChimp (newsletter service)
    
    To be clear, the use of those services is partially possible in a GDPR compliant way in the EU.
    
    There are website-builders by EU-based companies, but none of them come close to the functionality and ease of use of those named above. Same goes for office suites, video platforms, and newsletter services. And this list is just the tip of the iceberg.
    
    Here are some GDPR compliant alternatives I am using. I use them myself, because I tested them and decided I liked their offering. Only after being a customer and trying them for months or years did I try to get affiliate links. If you click on an affiliate link and decide to become a customer I get a commission:
