The website twitterisgoinggreat.com has shut down. In their own words:

> Deluded billionaire Elon Musk continues to spew stupid ideas that exhausted engineers are forced to rush through half baked, the company moves inexorably closer to bankruptcy, white supremacists increasingly dominate everyone’s feeds, the few remaining lawyers cave instantly to authoritarians, the platform’s reliability plummets ever downwards... and we need a break.[^gone]

I enjoyed not needing to be on Twitter itself to watch this slow-motion death of my formerly favorite website. If this is the first time you hear about this project, go visit their site and scroll for a bit. Maybe make yourself popcorn or a strong drink before you get started?
