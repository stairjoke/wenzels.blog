## Hello ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Wenzel, a freelance UX & UI designer, technology enthusiast, and digital nomad. I write this blog about design, technology, and sometimes other things. The name of this blog is an allusion to the spinning disk cursor Apple computers display when an application becomes unresponsiveâ€”also known as the beachball, the spinning wheel of death, or the rainbow of doom.

Computers are why I studied design, and humans are why I work as a designer. Iâ€™ve been fascinated by technology ever since I wrote my first line of BASIC code on my dadâ€™s Atari Mega STE when I was eight. Eventually, and after much tinkering, I decided that this was what I wanted to do for a living, studied design, and taught myself to code.

These days I spend my time figuring out how a person using a digital device can accomplish a set goal easily and without instructions.
