	<p>Title: Apple software quality and declining Mac sales</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Mac business was hit particularly hard, down 34 percent year over year. […] “I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter,” [Tim] <nobr>Cook.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></nobr></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tim Cook thinks the problem is hardware and that the M3 will change that. I’m pretty sure the declining software quality coming from Apple is playing a role in those 34%, more so than their hardware.</p>
<p>Anybody with an M1 or more recent Mac is pretty unlikely to buy a new one for a while, the hardware Apple put out in recent years is darn good. My M1 is still a faster computer than I need.</p>
