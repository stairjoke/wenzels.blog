	<h1>On the deterioration of search results</h1>
	<blockquote>
<p>[Searching] for a clearly-written one-line programming question used to produce excellent results from Google Search. For a number of years, though, search results for queries like that — both at Google and competing search engines — have been littered with junk generated by content farms. It’s like finding a needle in a haystack sometimes, combing through the query results for a proper solution.[^daringfireball]</p>

<p>[^daringfireball]: <cite>(link: https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/01/24/chatgpt-google-search text: ChatGPT: The First True Threat to Google Search? target: _blank)</cite> published January 24, 2023 by John Gruber on daringfireball.net.</p>
<p>Gruber makes an excellent point here that has been getting pointier for years. It used to be impressively useful to ask Google. Just type a question, especially a code related question, or paste in an error message, and the first result would be the correct answer.</p>
<p>A few years later, the first two result would become an ad and I got used to scrolling past them before reading anything. And even a few years more, the number of ads increased and I got used to scrolling past those as well. But these days the ads are sometimes more useful than the search results. The top-most ad usually is either a content-farm spam-page that tries to lure you in with seemingly helpful key phrases, or, like one third of the time, an actually useful search result.</p>
<p>Microsoft collaborating with OpenAI to connect Bing and ChatGPT might — dare I say <em>will?</em> — revolutionize search. We might finally have found a truly awesome SPAM filter: We let AI read the human-made mess and ask it to write unique replies to our questions. This is great! Part of me still wants to find a way to shut down content farms, but I guess this might just do the trick…</p>
<h2>Update, same day</h2>
<p>This should not just be stressful for Google, it may also be the end of SEO as we know it.</p>
<h2>Update, Feb 16, 2023</h2>
<p>Looks like Sydney, uhm Bing, the language model Microsoft used to build the chat interface, has some weird quirks (for an algorithm that is): (link: /blog/2023/February/chatGPT-bing text: The problem with language models (Bing / ChatGPT))</p>
