	<p>When Apple announced Apple Intelligence (AAI), the company plainly stated that it would be in English only, with more languages rolling out later‚Äîprobably not before next year. With that, Apple also implied, and later confirmed, that the launch of AAI would follow a similar pattern as that of other new products: USA first, then expand into other regions carefully, but as quickly as safely possible. In the weeks since AAI was announced, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183251/apple-eu-delay-ai-screen-mirroring-shareplay-dma" class="external-link" target="_blank">Apple released a statement that blames the DMA for the delayed rollout in Europe,</a> and many European commentators are fuming.</p>
<h3>The European market is weak and risky</h3>
<p>I am a European commentator of many things Apple‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not fuming. Why am I not sitting here, hacking angrily into my keyboard, calling Apple names? Well, let‚Äôs explore this:</p>
<p>The European market is, comparatively, unimportant to Apple when viewed side-by-side with the US, Chinese, and Indian markets. It is also a high-risk market. Yes, because of the DMA and how &quot;Spirit of the law‚Äù legislation works.</p>
<h3>Spirit of the law vs. letter of the law</h3>
<p>Where other regions carefully craft legislation within which a company has obvious boundaries within which it can operate at relatively low risk, the European Union is a region where the law works as follows:</p>
<p>The government(s) find an intent for a law they then draft. The <em>text of the law</em> attempts to explain how the legislative powers imagine this intent should be translated into action. The text of the law is sometimes left unclear on purpose, to give the government‚Äôs enforcement bodies sufficient wiggle room to execute <em>the intent of the law,</em> rather than the letter. Some will say this is a terrible system because it introduces uncertainty and others will argue that it reduces bloat because that way you don‚Äôt need to have amendments for laws to re-word the law to express the intent more clearly. There are many more pros and cons to letter of the law and spirit of the law practices, like case law, which is a nightmare in the US, but I‚Äôll avoid becoming philosophical. The reality is more nuanced and complicated than my summary, and legal experts will likely object to how I put it, but that‚Äôs the gist of it‚Äîas far as I understand it.</p>
<h3>The intent of the DMA and the consequences of uncertainty</h3>
<p>The EU has made it plain what the intent, usually called ‚ÄúSpirit of the law‚Äù, of the DMA is: <em>To enforce, within specific, and very large companies, behaviors that enable competition and punish anti-competitive practices.</em> EU spokespeople have repeatedly reiterated this intent publicly, as they did again in this situation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>This intent means that select companies, called gatekeepers, are sailing in uncertain waters whenever they release a new feature that might be seen as sabotaging fair competition <em>within their platform.</em> This produces uncertainty, which directly translates into risk for the gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Apple announced that AAI would be rolled out later for EU customers, because of the DMA. Apple is taking time to evaluate the risk of getting fined by the EC (European Commission) and to take measures that enable competition. This means the DMA is working, whether we like how it is working or not.</p>
<p>As a result, we have some fuming European commentators, angry at Apple for delaying AAI. I am willing to bet the same commentators would be cheering on any fines the EC might impose if Apple released AAI in the EU and was found guilty of anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>We, the European Apple fanboys, can‚Äôt have it both ways‚Äîbut clearly ‚Äúwe‚Äù think we should have it both ways. We overestimate the European region‚Äôs market relevancy, just like the EC does with its arrogant method of calculating fines based on <em>global revenue</em> instead of European revenue. For Apple to take that risk, however, the EU market is not important enough.</p>

<p>On an aside, while reading <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/06/eu_reaping_what_it_sows" class="external-link" target="_blank">Gruber‚Äôs comments</a> I once again ask myself if he is unwilling or incapable of understanding statements such as these. His commentary recently has been cynical at best, if not downright hostile. He is correct, however, about the EU having no relevant competitors in the phone market. A result of decades of utter ineptitude by the governments of Europe. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p>
