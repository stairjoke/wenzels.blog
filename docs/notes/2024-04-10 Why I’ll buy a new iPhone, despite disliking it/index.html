	<h1>Why I’ll buy a new iPhone, despite disliking it</h1>
	<p>Tldr: Its the best smartphone available, in my opinion. There are tons of things, I think could be better about the iPhone, but at the end of the day, I’m more in sync with Apple’s philosophy than Google’s.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yet another Apple-bashing post? It might seem like it, but I don’t think of it as bashing and it is not meant to be. I’m quite heavily invested in the Apple-Ecosystem, because for about two decades, I trusted it would be a company who’s products and decisions I’d mostly like for a long time. I’m not sure I still trust Apple to continue to be that company long-term, but for now, it still is. I value good product design, deep integration of hardware and software, and I like the philosophy.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I wrote the following message and submitted it to <a href="https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Apple’s feedback system.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Apple,
I used to be an early-adopter and I’d love to buy a new phone. The price is not the issue keeping me from buying a new iPhone. The problem is that the camera mountain is too huge for me to feel comfortable switching from my 12 Pro to a newer model. I don’t want it. I hate the choice to make it wobble when placed on a flat surface, it annoys me. Also, in Europe, iMessage is the David to the Goliath that is WhatsApp, and your refusal to connect to it hurts iMessage and iPhone, not Android. The thought that isolating iMessage protects iPhone is a very US-centric one and does not apply in the EU.</p>
<p>Will I buy a new iPhone anyways? Probably, but I’ll hold off on that purchase as long as possible. I used to be an early-adopter.</p>
<p>Kind regards,
Wenzel</p>
