	<p>I had a Twitter account from 2007 until 2023, and 99.9% of my posts are gone or buried in a gigantic data-dump that I downloaded sometime around 2019. I regret not writing more of my thoughts down elsewhere. Like on a blog, or at least take notes for me personally.</p>
<p>I actually started my publishing journey on Blogger when I was 13, falling for conspiracy theories and having opinions back then that make my toes curl with embarrassment these days. I’m glad that content is gone, and I hope nobody archived it — as a teenager, I had no idea that the internet does not forget. Yet, I still wish I’d written more of my thoughts down in a way that was less ephemeral and more searchable. A place I could dig through to pick out the good stuff!</p>
<p>Today, I look at people publishing literal blog posts on Reddit, sending newsletters via Substack, or posting on Medium, and I wonder how they'll feel when those platforms close down, get sold, or make decisions similar to Twitter’s decision to sell to Musk. I've been burned too many times to want to blog on anything but my own website.</p>
