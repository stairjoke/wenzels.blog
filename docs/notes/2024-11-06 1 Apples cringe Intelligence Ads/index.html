		<h1>Apple‚Äôs recent Apple Intelligence ads are disturbing</h1>

	<p>Apple recently published a series of ads that make me want to run away screaming. I actually think these ads hurt Apple‚Äôs brand, and I certainly dislike their AI product more after watching them than before. Apple‚Äôs recent series of terrible ads started with <a href="https://youtu.be/ntjkwIXWtrc?si=VVKFfuM8P_wdpOP7" class="external-link" target="_blank">the crushing ad for iPad Pro.</a> In it,  a hydraulic press crushed art, instruments, creative tools, etc. into a flat shape with paint running down the sides of the press as if the items were bleeding. The outcry about this ad was strong and very negative,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> you‚Äôd think Apple took this to heart and tried to learn from it, right? Well, apparently not.</p>
<p>Apple had two main themes with its recent AI ads: Lying and Incompetence.</p>
<h2>Apple Intelligence | Catch up quick | MacBook Pro</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BK8bnkcT0Ng?si=5SBVa43IH9j5FE5u" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2>Apple Intelligence | Email summary | iPhone 16 Pro</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_eJy6QyHaFM?si=bxsJ7bAsJQAFe5wL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>These two promote lying and not doing your job in a cringy way. I actually had to force myself to watch them to write this post, otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have. They also suggest that the main characters are replaceable by AI and should be fired immediately.</p>
<h2>Apple Intelligence | More personal Siri | iPhone 16 Pro</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TPe8revsg3k?si=2c8d9Hu_UHUWBFVw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This one is worse. It promotes lying, but on a personal level. She‚Äôs the new employee in this story, and nobody would expect her to remember the name of someone she had a meeting with ‚Äúa couple of months ago‚Äù, the other character actually says exactly that. Yet, instead of having a normal human interaction, she uses AI to query his name and then pretends she remembered him. Apple seems to suggest fake caring is a good thing, and with that, here is another one promoting lying for no good reason:</p>
<h2>Apple Intelligence | Create memory movies | iPhone 16</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0BXZhdDqZM?si=cTwNLWAP6VOnPnZp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. The dad‚Äôs first line is: &quot;We said no gifts‚Ä¶&quot;, setting the stage emotionally. His wife not having a gift is not the issue here, yet Apple suggests that in response to the surprise gifts from her daughters, she must trump them‚Äîwhich is, I think, a toxic behavior. The fact that she uses AI to generate a short movie with memories doesn‚Äôt really bother me, but the scenario in which she uses AI is disturbing. To relax, lets move on to the next, which is, for a change, not terrible:</p>
<h2>Apple Intelligence | Custom memory movies | iPhone 16 Pro</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EcHUOKPDMFU?si=Z6rW8skUTlRE7AT1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This one, I think, is actually fine‚Äîexcept the smug face. The difference is that Apple Intelligence is used to stop the dad from lying. Instead of an AI assisted lie, the ad promotes using AI to generate a short movie remembering the daughter‚Äôs pet fish. The family watches it to stop the dad from pretending he cares. At last, a little bit of honesty!</p>
<h2>Apple Intelligence | Change your tone | MacBook Pro</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/deNzYrTvqCs?si=3SnbJJmqKvzuKIIq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This one suggests that instead of processing your anger yourself, and calming the fuck down, you should just write an angry letter and have Apple Intelligence re-write it to remove all personality and make it sound soulless. The original text in the video is actually funny, but it also mentions a description of his job that is very ironic: ‚ÄúThat pudding was my only light in an otherwise bleak corporate existence‚Äù. Once Apple Intelligence is done rewriting his email, it truly is a bleak corporate fake-positive email.</p>
<p><strong>The original email in this ad:</strong></p>
<p><figure><img src="assets/2024-06-28%20Europe‚Äôs%20IT%20problem%20-%20How%20GDPR%20and%20DMA%20have%20unintended%20consequences.md/CleanShot%202024-11-05%20at%2011.30.40@2x.jpeg" /><figcaption>To the inconsiderate monster who has been stealing my pudding, IT WAS MY PUDDING. Mine. NOT YOURS. My name was written on it. VERY CLEARLY. In permanent ink. What kind of freeloader would think to themselves, &quot;You know what, I'm going to take someone else's pudding. I deserve it?&quot; When in fact, you do not. We used to believe that SNACKS ARE SACRED in this company. I still believe it. Snacks ARE sacred. That pudding was my only light in an otherwise bleak corporate existence. And you extinguished that light. It was a little taste of goodness, and you have ruined it with your unconscionable badness. When you're enjoying the tainted treat. I hope you think long and hard about what you've done. I hope you are filled with the shame and guilt. I hope your conscience eats at you like you have eaten my pudding. BRING MY PUDDING ..!!!!! I wish you the worst. Dale</figcaption></figure></p>
<p><strong>The AI version:</strong></p>
<p><figure><img src="assets/2024-06-28%20Europe‚Äôs%20IT%20problem%20-%20How%20GDPR%20and%20DMA%20have%20unintended%20consequences.md/CleanShot%202024-11-05%20at%2011.30.55@2x.jpeg" /><figcaption>Hey there, I'm writing to you about something that's been bothering me for a while now. You see, I've noticed that my pudding has been going missing from the fridge. Now, I know this might sound a bit strange, but I really do care about my pudding. It's not just any pudding, it's my special treat that I look forward to every day. I've written my name on it in permanent ink, just to make sure that no one else can mistake it for theirs. But it seems like you've been taking it anyway. And I can't help but feel a little bit hurt and disappointed. You see, snacks are a big deal in our company. We take them very seriously, and we believe that they're a source of joy and comfort. And my pudding was my little slice of heaven in a world that can sometimes feel a bit too serious. So, I'm asking you to please return my pudding. I know it's not much, but it means a lot to me. And I would really appreciate it if you could keep an eye out for it in the future. Thanks for your understanding, Dale</figcaption></figure>Honestly, if I received the original in my inbox I‚Äôd feel more, and genuine empathy, than if I got the AI version.</p>
<h2>Apple Intelligence | Writing Tools | iPhone 16</h2>

<p>In this one we go from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey J,</p>
<p>Been thinking, this project might need a bit of zhuhzing. But you're the big enchilada.
Holler back,</p>
<p>üí™warrenüí™</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey J,</p>
<p>Upon further consideration, I believe this project may require some refinement. However, you are the most capable individual to undertake this task.</p>
<p>Please let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Warren</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More professional? Sure. Less personal and dead feeling? Absolutely! And if you watch it to the end you‚Äôll see that the ad basically suggests faking it if you‚Äôre incompetent. Yet another example of what I wrote above: &quot;They also suggest that the main characters are replacible by AI and should be fired immediately.&quot;</p>
<h1>A Reminder</h1>
<p>Remember how Apple promoted its AI products at WWDC? They gave tons of examples that were largely positive‚Äîinstead of cringe. From Minutes 1:12 to 1:24 Apple actually shows a clip from the only ad they ran recently that was pleasant to watch. I shared it above, its the &quot;Custom memory movies&quot; ad.</p>

<p>After this rant, I feel I should clarify on one point: I‚Äôm not opposed to AI in principle. However, most AI training is done under inhumane conditions<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> and a lot of it using stolen intellectual property.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> I see the utility and value of AI when used right. These ads, however, for the most part, promote using AI in morally dubious ways.</p>
